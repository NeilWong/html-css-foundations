Cascade ordering for CSS styling
1) Importance
2) Specificity
    - class selector > element selector
    - Only properties are overwritten, not entire rules
3) Source Order
    - If multiple styles have the same importance and specifictiy, then whichever style is placed closest to the
        end of the script is used/overwrites the previous ones
